        <h2>Perfect casserole for Breakfast or Brunch</h2>
        <p>This recipe was given to me, and I continue to pass it down to everyone who tries it! Aside from being so delicious, it's so versatile that I've even used it as a side dish for steak! This can be made the night before, then baked the next day -- allow 10 extra minutes of cooking time.</p>
